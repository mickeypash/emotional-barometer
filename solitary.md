# Solitary

Because our culture places such a high value on sociability. It
can be deeply awkward to have to explain how much - at certain
points - we need to be alone.

We may try to pass off our desire as something work-related
people generally understand a need to finish off a project, But
in truth it's a far less respectable and more profound desire that
is driving us unless we are alone, we are at risk of forgetting
who we are.

We, the ones who are asphyxiated without periods by ourselves
take other people very seriously - perhaps more seriously than
those in the uncomplicated ranks of the endlessly gregarious.
We listen closely to stories we give ourselves to others, we
respond with emothion and emphathy. But as a result, we cannot
keep swimming in company indefinitely.

We need to alone because life among other people unfolds
too quickly. The pace is relentless: the jokes, the insights, the
excitements. There can sometimes be enough in five minutes
of social life to take up an hour of analysis. It is a quirk of our
mind that not every emotion that impacts us is at once fully
acknowledged, understood or even - if it were - truly felt.
After time among others, there are a myriad of sensations that
exist in an 'unprocessed' form within us. Perphas an idea that
someone raised made us anxious, prompting ?????? impulses
for change in our lives. Perhaps an anecdote sparked off an
endless ambition that is that is worth decoding and listening to in
order to grow. Maybe someone subtly fired an aggressive dart
at us and we havent had the chance to relise we are hurt. We
need some quiet time to console ourselve by formulating an
explanation of where the nastiness might have come from. We
are more vulnerable and tender-skinned than we're encouraged
to imagine.

By retreating in oureselves, it looks as if we are the enemies of
others, but our solitary moments are in reality a homage to the
richness of social existance. Unless we've had time alone, we
can't be who we would like to be around our fellow humans. We
won't have original opinions. We won't have lively and authentic
perspectives. We'll be - in the wrong way - a bit like everyone
else.

We're drawn to solitude not because we despise humanity but
because we are properly responsive to what the company of
others entails. Extenive stretches of being alone may in reality
be a precondition for knowing how to be a friend and a
properly attentive companion.
