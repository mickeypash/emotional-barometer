# Grateful

The stadnard habit of the mid is to take careful note of what's 
not right in our lives and obsess about all tha is missing.

But in a new mood, perhaps after a lot of longing and turmoil, 
we pause and notice some of what has - remarkably - not gone 
wrong. The house is looking beautiful at the momemnt. We're 
in pretty good health, all things considered. The afternoon sun 
is deeply reasurring. Sometime the children are kind. Our 
partner is - at point - very generous. It's been quite mild lately. 
Yesterday, we were happy all evening. We're quite enjoying our 
work at the moment.

Gratitude is a mood that grows with age. It is extremely rare 
properly to delight in flower or quit evening at home, a cup 
of tea or a walk in the woods when we are under twenty-two.
There are so many larger, grander things to be concerned about: 
romantic love, career fulfilment and political change.

However, as time goes on, it is rare to be left entirely indifferent 
by smaller things. Gradually, almost all of our ealier, larger 
aspirations take a hit; perhaps a very large one. We encounter 
some of the intractable problmes of intimate relationships. We 
suffer the gap between our professional hopes and the available 
realities. We have a chance to observe how slowly and fitfully the 
world ever alters in a positive direction. We are fully inducted 
into the extent of human wickedness and folly - and our own 
eccentricity, selfishness and mandness.

Therefore, 'little things' start to seem somewhat different; no 
longer a petty distraction from a mighty destiny, no longer an 
insult to ambition, but genuine please amind a litany of 
troubles, and invitation to braket anxieties and keep self-criticism 
at bay, a small resting place for hope in a sea of dissapointment.
We appreciate the slice of toast, the friendly encounter, the long 
hot bath, the spring morning - and keep in mind how much 
worse it could be.
