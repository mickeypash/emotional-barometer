# Emotional Barometer

Consider buying the book [here](https://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/emotional-barometer/) and support the School of Life.

## Intro

I came across this book while watching a [School of Life YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog). The idea came to me to create a simple website. This is just for me to learn more about D3, maths, potentially a frameworks such as React/VueJS. Also I'm hoping it sparks conversations about how we actually feel instead of just staying "Fine/Good/Alright".

## Goals
- [x] Make sure to add attributions
- [ ] Keep it as bold, beautify and simple as possible
- [x] Purchase `emotional.bar`, it was too good to pass up ($64 reduced to $2)
- [ ] Rotation should be manual, currently is a wheel of fortune because that's the code snippet I could find.
- [ ] Once you rotate to an emotion, a subtle transition should occur.
    * Updating the page to the emotion's description
    * Updating the URL to the appropriate emotion's page `emotional.bar/grateful`
