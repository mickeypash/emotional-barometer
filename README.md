# Emotional Barometer

For some time now I've been following The School of Life [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel).
They have some really engaging and insightful content! 
Apart from making thought provoking videos, they also have a website and a [online store](https://www.theschooloflife.com/).
There they sell all sorts of products that help us reflect and be more at piece with ourselves.

One such product is the [Emotional Barometer](https://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/emotional-barometer/), which is meant to 
help you understand your inner "emotional weather". It offers definitions of 20 moods that most of us experience but 
find it hard to explain. Each card contains an essay describing the emotion, what causes it, how it affects us and what it 
might be able to teach us.

I wanted to capture this notion in online form. The idea is simple:
- Create a simple HTML/JS/CSS interactive barometer
- People are to select the emotion they are feeling
- That should trigger an event leading them to the essay on that emotion
- Each emotion should have a perm link such as `http://emotional.bar/nostalgia`
- This way people can share their emotions with their friends, family and even colleagues
