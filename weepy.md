# Weepy

We're not actually crying at the moment, but the tears are far 
closer to the surface than they normally would be. A whole host 
of relatively minor things threatens to set us off. Strangley, they 
aren't the grim things we might associate with crying; they're 
things that feel especially beautiful, tender or pure.

We might feel our eyes moistening at the sight of some delicate 
floweres breaking through the hard earth after a long winter; or a 
parent and child chatting animatedly together in a cafe (the kid 
is talking about a penguin they've seen in a book); or a friend 
who greets us in an unusually warm way; or moment in a film 
when moralistic father makes up with his wayward son.

The source of our weepiness is located in the place where the 
troubles of life collide with what is still kind and good in the 
world.

The loveliness we see (in a file, in a park, in a book) makes the 
actual ugliness of day-to-day life all the more vivid. We want to 
cry at a poignant reminders of a kind of paradise that's ever more 
elusive, at what we crave and have bee exiled from.

If we are to consider the unusual project oftrying to create 
a robot that could feel weepy, we would have to do something 
apparently rather cruel; we would have to ensure that this robot 
knew about suffering; that it was able to hate itself and feel loss 
and confusion, for it is against this kind of background of pain 
that beautiful scenes become deeply important, rather than 
merely nice. Our weepiness is telling us something key: that our 
lives are tougher than they were when we were little, and 
that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is 
correspondingly all the more intense.

When we are weepy we dont' need to be cheered up or told to 
feel grateful for the good things we still have. Ideally, we'd like 
the sorrow in us to meet the sorrow in another person. It sounds 
odd, but perhaps we'd like to weep quietly for a bit with someone 
else who understands.
