# Practical

For too long, we've been slothful and indigent. But now, there's 
a crispness and purpose in the air, and we're ready for action. 
We're determined not to let doubts or complexities overwhelm 
us. We want to see tangible results. We're tired of being dreamers 
and shirkers.

Our practical mood is briskly impatient with perfectionism. 
We're not focused on how things could be, or might be, or 
what we'd do if money and time were of no concern. A lot of 
our previous procrastination was born out of fear: we didn't 
dare to make a start, in case we messed things up and let our 
ideals down. But now we're prepared to deal with the world as 
it actually is, and accept the constraints that reality imposes. 
Compromise doesn't sount like a bad word; it's a necessary and 
mature strategy for achieving results.

It might look as if we're a touch soulless; as if we can't
comprehend the poetry or complexity of exitence. This wouldn't 
be the time to play us a sonata or read us a passage of philosophy.
But what we'd like people to graps is that we my have come to 
this clear, energetic mood via quite a hard road. We know all 
about the temptations of idelness; we recognise perfectly well 
the allure of meandering reverie. We know from the inside how 
endless speculation, perfectionism, and wishing things were 
different are the enemies of getting things done. We're not 
determined to find relaistic solutions because we're bald or 
shallow, but because we've got so much intimate experience of 
aimless drifting. Now-  after an age - we're at least ready to get 
down to work.
